# PythonPrograms

Hello, I'm Pooja. I want to explore different platforms to enhance my skills. Inquisitive and quick to learn.

My first repository is dedicated to the codes of my summer classroom training(June-July,18) in Python.
Python is building blocks of Machine Learning which will be taught in later classes.
